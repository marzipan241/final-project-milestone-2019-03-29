## Gabriel Walker: A tool for exploring trends in Chinese elite diplomacy and overseas financial flows.

####Pros

* Hot topic

* Extremely advanced interface (I nearly cried looking at this), involves a substantial amount of data points and information

* Map is extremely thorough: clicking on each point reveals a summary of Funder, Sector, Description, etc. of the aid or investment in that location

* Expansion of points on map into a web of each investment was visual awesomeness

* The plots of what industries China invested in for each country where incredibly useful

* The timeline and tables summarizing the investments reinforced key information

* Potential as a database for future research on this topic


####Cons

* Extremely intimidating as a final project: how do we make something on par with this given time and knowledge limitations?

* Information conveyed is overwhelming, I would love to see a report of maybe a few key elites and trends in their investments and what it says about their political ambitions, but this is probably a PhD

* Zooming out of the map yields a repeating world map, some points in the Pacific Ocean were on the far left, others on the far right

* It would be cool to see what was ultimately done with the investments and aid (were they accepted, appropriately allocated, etc.)

* Overlaying plans for the Belt and Road Initiative (One Belt One Road) may yield fascinating results
